# MyWebsite
Overview

This is Full stack web app, that uses React js in the front-end and Nodes Js/ Express/ Mongoose in the back end. The back-end is connected to a Mongo DB
Database. Where messages that are sent to me are stored for me to look at.

Features

   Displays my skills and Projects in an easy to see format
   Provides a way for someone to download my resume
   In The mail, section someone can send me a message with their email, and a body. On submit this sends a post request to 'https://hidden-bayou-27100.herokuapp.com/email'
   wit the content. This route is where I hosted the backend server for this app. And once this route gets the content, it splices it and stored the info in a
   mongo db database that I can acess.
   
Site Acess
   you can acess the site at https://secret-mountain-76791.herokuapp.com/. It might take some time to load because heroku, puts the app to sleep.
Cloning
   You can clone the repo if you want to use it and change the code based on what you need. You would also need to create your own server or find you own way to implement that.
